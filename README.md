## What you'll need to start
### Environment
To run the code, the following software is required to be installed on your local machine.

Docker Desktop (http://www.docker.com). Please note that a user account should be created from the Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/) website. 

To install on Mac,  please refer to this link. 

```
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
```

To install on Windows, please refer to this link.
```
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
```
To install on Linux (Ubuntu, CentOs or others), please refer to this link.
```
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
```
Git (optional but recommended)

Windows, 
```
https://git-scm.com/download/win 
```
Mac or Linux, 
```
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
```	
Then, the source code of the lessons can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. 

```
https://github.com/iqoqo/sdc2019
```

To download the code, you can use the following command with a command-line interface. 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/iqoqo/sdc2019
```


To run the lessons, you can use the run scripts we provided. 

```
sh run_lesson.sh <lesson number> 
```
In Windows, you will run this in a Command Prompt at the project root directory.  

``` 
.\run_lesson_windows.bat <lesson number> 
```
For example, to run the solution in lesson 1, we enter this at the project root directory.

```
sh run_lesson.sh 1
```



## What we'll do today
1) Look at a cool example of a toy image and video processing code
2) Use Dis.co for parallel batch computing using the Dis.co's command-line interface (CLI) 
3) See how we can use the Dis.co Python APIs to parallelize our code for higher performance
